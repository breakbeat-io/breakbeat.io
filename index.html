        <h3>Jewel - Listen Later for Music</h3>
        <h6>Coming soon to the Apple App Store!</h6>
        <p>Jewel is a 'listen later' companion app for Apple Music. Heard about or remembered an album but not ready to listen?  Add it to your Jewel collection to play later!</p>
        <p>Apple Music gives us access to all the music in the world -- but what should you listen too?</p>
        <p>If you're anything like us, sometimes you're told about an album or remember a great one while doing something else - when you're not able to listen. Then, when the time is right, you've forgotten about them and end up listening to the same handful of albums you always have, or just hit shuffle on one of the playlists. Well no more!</p>
        <p>Jewel gives you 8 slots in order to save any album from the Apple Music library - which is basically any album ever!  Add it to your collection when you first think about it, then when you're ready to listen - bam! - there it is waiting to be played!  It's like bookmarking for albums.</p>
        <p>It's not just for new music either - maybe you've already curated a personal library of 100's of albums from the millions available on Apple Music, but still think 'what shall I listen to _right now_'?  Use Jewel as your rolling 'must plays' - a special collection if you will.</p>
        <p>Or simply use Jewel to create an 'album playlist'.  Create a collection that represents an special event or theme - your favourite albums, a selection of summer albums, the ones you used to listen to at school, ones for that road trip - any collection so that you can easily find them within the rest of your library!</p>
        <p>Jewel helps you remember to listen.</p>
